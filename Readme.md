**Title: Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier**

**Description:**
This Python script performs sentiment analysis on textual input using a Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier predicts whether the input text represents a positive or negative sentiment. It achieves this by utilizing a dataset of movie reviews to train the model, employing techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and Naive Bayes classification.
